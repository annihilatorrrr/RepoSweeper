 <h1 align='center'> RepoSweeper (Mass-Delete GitHub Repositories) </h1>

 <img src="./RepoSweeper.png" alt=""/>

 Deleting GitHub repositories via the GitHub interface is a hassle. For each repository that you want to delete, you have to go to the individual repository settings, enter the name of the repository and confirm. This is not a scalable as task. There are many scripts you can use to bulk erase repositories from the command line, but they don't offer much flexibility. RepoSweeper is a React.js SPA that allows you to sort, filter and manage which repositories you want to delete, and to do so in one click of a button.

 <h3>Getting Started</h3>
 RepoSweeper is a tool that is meant to be used as a web application. It is pretty slim on the code side. If you just want to use the tool, visit https://reposweeper.com/
